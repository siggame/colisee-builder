## Description

The purpose of this application is to provide a service to the ACM SIG-Game Web team to build competitor code. A competitor will log into the Web team's general user interface and upload a new zip file to submit to the tournament. The Web team will request this service to add this zip file to the queue. The builder will give back a unique ID of the build and the web team will occasionally ping the service to check if the build has finished. When the build has finished, the Web team will retrieve the gamelog as well as the built Docker Image from the service in a reasonable amount of time[1].

> [1] Given that the competition is 24 hours, and that a competitor will expect the build to be running in a live environment ASAP, we can assume a reasonable amount time is defined as 5 minutes. At any point in time beyond 5 minutes, the builder service cannot guarantee that the requested data was preserved. Ideally the Web Server will retrieve the data within **5 seconds** of the build being completed.

## Getting Started

Using docker.

```bash
docker pull siggame/colisee-builder
```

Using npm.

```bash
npm run setup && npm run start:prod
```

## Usage

### REST API

#### Interfaces

The following interfaces & types are defined and referenced below in the API endpoints.

```typescript
type BuildStatusType = "queued" | "building" | "failed" | "succeeded";

interface BuildStatus {
    id: string;
    status: BuildStatusType;
    startedTime: DateTime;
    finishedTime: DateTime | null;
}

// https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-errors
interface HttpError {
    status: number;
    statusCode: string;
    message: string;
}
```

#### API
-----------------------------------------

**200 - Retrieved build status**
```
{
    statuses: BuildStatus[];
}
```
**400 - Bad Request**
```
HttpError
```

-----------------------------------------
#### `GET /{id}` Retrieve status of a build

```
**400 - Bad Request; 404 - Not Found**
```
HttpError
```

-----------------------------------------
#### `GET /{id}/log` Retrieve log of a build
